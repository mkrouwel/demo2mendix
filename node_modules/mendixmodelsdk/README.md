# Mendix Model SDK

The Mendix Model SDK is a TypeScript- & JavaScript-based SDK that, through the Model SDK, provides access to the inner-workings of every Mendix app.

With the [Platform SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mendixplatformsdk) and Model SDK, you can do the following:

- **Read** from your app model (for example, analyze the quality of your app model, or generate a high-level diagram to document your app)
- **Write** to your app model (for example, create a new entity in your domain model, add an activity to an existing microflow, even generate a whole new Mendix app based on a legacy code base)

Basically, the [Platform SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mendixplatformsdk) and Model SDK allow you to automate any tedious or error-prone task. If you imagine it, thereâ€™s probably a way to do it via these SDKs.
